# url-rat
A browser extension to send visited URLs to a server, written as a test.

This is working from [Mozilla's series of posts](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/Your_first_WebExtension) to start, just to make sure this works.  So, if you see any code that isn't sending URLs to a server, that's why.

The premise and steps to creating it were described in [this blog post](https://john.colagioia.net/blog/2020/06/17/plugin.html).
